            <P style="padding-top: 20px;">Hi ! <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I'm Oluwole Emmanuel Adekunbi, a young developer in my mid twenties, i'm the first of a three children in a family of five beautiful people, i have my roots in Abeokuta area of Ogun, Nigeria, but i was born and bred in Lagos, Nigeria. i completed my elementary/Basic eduction at Elshaddai schools in (2008) and was immediately accepted into her secondary school where i completed junior secondary, before transfering to Bosworth college int'l, to complete the my higher secondary school education. This i did in june (2014) and was Granted admission into The Bells University of technology, for the commencement of my first degree programme in computer Engineering, but i came unstuck in my 3rd year when i had to step down due to financial constraints. While im hoping to one day complete my programme, i've tried to make the most of what i've got and clinged to life as hard as i can. I've worked several jobs over the years, including; data entry officer, production officer, cashier, factory utility/auxiliary staff, mathematics teacher, private home tutor/coach etc. as well as a few training programmes which include Customer service, catering, web development, etc. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I've always had a limited amount of time in each Job role in the past, as im am always looking for ways to return to school, but i've been able to gather experience working independently and as a team member, both on-site and in a remote workspace, as well as a strong experience in leadership roles, which has afforded me experience and insights in the dynamics of team cohesion. i also have a keen sense of responsibility, coupled with resilience which blosters my problem solving skills. i'm very optimistic, positive, innovative, emphatic and passionate about my work, my personality lends itself to giving my all to what i do as i hate to be caught lacking in any department. i have a keen sense of gratitude and courtesy which blosters my relationship with others.
